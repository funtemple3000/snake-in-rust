# Snake in Rust!

I have rewritten snake in Rust. It is not perfect, but it should be good enough.

To run, first install rust. You may need to restart your terminal session.
Download the repository, and then change directory to the repo.

Then, run this command:
`cargo run`
This should run the program.

I hope you like it!
